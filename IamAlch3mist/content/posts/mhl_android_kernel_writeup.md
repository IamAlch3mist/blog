Recently I solved the tryout labs an Android kernel exploitation challenge, the challenge involved exploiting an UAF bug in the android kernel driver to gain local privilege escalation. 

you can find my writeup in the below link

Edit: 

I also solved the AI Accelerator challenge (yet another android kernel exploitation challenge ðŸ˜„) and eventually the first one to solve the challenge. I'm in the process of creating an writeup for it.
